# About
- This app using the <a href="https://date.nager.at>Nager.date<a> API to access data about all of the holidays happening in countries around the world.
- I also used an <a href="https://mapsvg.com/maps/world">mapsvg<a>'s map of the world to make a clickable interface for a user to get information about public holidays.

# Improvements
- Sizing the SVG to make it look like a normal map was difficult, and could be tweaked.
- Adding more features! And sprucing up the styling.
